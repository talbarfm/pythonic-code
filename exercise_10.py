def calculate_score(player_data: List[Dict[str, Union[str, List[Dict[str, str]]]]]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Takes a list of player data dictionaries, and returns a dictionary with the player names as keys and
    their corresponding scores as values.

    The player data is expected to be in the following format:
    [
        {
            "name": "Player 1",
            "moves": [
                {"move": "rock", "result": "win"},
                {"move": "paper", "result": "loss"},
                {"move": "scissors", "result": "win"},
                {"move": "rock", "result": "tie"}
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Player 2",
            "moves": [
                {"move": "rock", "result": "loss"},
                {"move": "paper", "result": "win"},
                {"move": "scissors", "result": "loss"},
                {"move": "rock", "result": "loss"}
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]

    The function calculates the scores of each player based on their game moves, with the following scoring rules:
    - A win earns 2 points
    - A loss earns 0 points
    - A tie earns 1 point

    Returns a dictionary with the player names as keys and their scores as values.
